# Server configuration

you need to download the Lavalink server ([lavalink-devs/Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink)) and run it, or use other public nodes.  

If you need public nodes, you can refer to the following repository.  
* [DarrenOfficial/lavalink-list](https://github.com/DarrenOfficial/lavalink-list)
* [brblacky/lavalink-list](https://github.com/brblacky/lavalink-list)


## Deploying with Binary

Download binaries from the [Download Server](https://repo.arbjerg.dev/artifacts/lavalink/), [GitHub releases](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases) or [GitHub actions](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/actions).

Put an `application.yml` file in your working directory. ([Example here](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example))  

Run with `java -jar Lavalink.jar` from the same directory.  


## Deploying with Docker

Docker images can be found on [Github packages](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/pkgs/container/lavalink) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fredboat/lavalink/).  

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  

Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yml
services:
    lavalink:
        image: fredboat/lavalink:4.0.8 # pin the image version to Lavalink v4
        container_name: lavalink_v4
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
            - _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx6G # set Java options here
            - SERVER_PORT=2333 # set lavalink server port
            - LAVALINK_SERVER_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass # set password for lavalink
        volumes:
            - ./application.yml:/opt/Lavalink/application.yml # mount application.yml from the same directory or use environment variables
            - ./plugins/:/opt/Lavalink/plugins/ # persist plugins between restarts, make sure to set the correct permissions (user: 322, group: 322)
        networks:
            - lavalink
        expose:
            - 2333 # lavalink exposes port 2333 to connect to for other containers (this is for documentation purposes only)
        ports:
            - 2333:2333 # you only need this if you want to make your lavalink accessible from outside of containers
networks:
    lavalink: # create a lavalink network you can add other containers to, to give them access to Lavalink
        name: lavalink
```

Place the `application.yml` in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`.
